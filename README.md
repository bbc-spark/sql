#sql

<b>SQL (Structured Query Language)</b> is a standard for handling relational data. SQL has many different versions, including SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft Access, DB2, and many others. Here are projects I have worked on and which may prove beneficial for anyone who manage data in databases.

SQL Server is a powerful database system with many components. The main component is the SQL Server Management Console but also includes SQL Server Integration Services, SQL Server Analysis Services, and other tools. These projects here include:

  -	Data Cleaning
